# maxlog

## Introduction
(Work In Progress)
Maxlog is a lighweight, header only logging library that allows the client to select whether they would like standard out and/or syslog logging.
It is a compact wrapper around syslog and std::cout that increases ease of printing variadic templated arguments and provides info on filename, line, function and timestamp.
